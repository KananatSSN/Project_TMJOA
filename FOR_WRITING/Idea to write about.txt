1. Yolo is predominantly used in TMJOA segmentation and classfication.
2. We purpose 2 steps solution 1. Condyle segmentation and then 2. Classification
	2.1 This is because TMJOA is ambiguous but condyle segementation is less so because it's not ambiguous whether a thing is a condyle or not
3. The current methodology require slice selection from the CBCT volume. Which is counter productive. Requiring more labeling effort, limiting scalability of the dataset.
4. Yolo, a 2D model is used despite CBCT image being 3D.
5. We purpose preprocessing step which we hope to fix generalization issue of the model by
	5.1 Inspecting the voxel value distribution of the input data
	5.2 Transfrom it to match the expected distribution, Guassian mixture
	5.3 Value clipping normalization
	5.4 Voxel size normalization to 0.125 mm
	5.5 Condyle segmentation by DentalSegmentator
	5.6 Condylar head centering and cropping with skeletonization
6. Data representation transformation
	There are multiple way to represent 3D image. We explore 3 way here 1. 2D images with max entropy. 2. Multiview and 3. 3D Voxel
	6.1 For 2D image with max entropy, we extract 2D layer from 3D volume by selecting the layer with max non bg ratio and then extract layer from n distance from such layer. This is because the layer that is in close ploximity to each other are similar.
	6.2 For Multiview we first transform voxel to mesh and then encode the average value from surface as color
	6.3 3D model input is as is
7. Model
	7.1 Yolo11m-cls for 2D layer and Multiview approch
		7.1.1 Trained for 200 epochs
		7.1.2 Default ultralytics yolo augmentation
	7.2 Quater width 3D Resnet18 for 3D
		7.2.1 Trained for 200 epochs
		7.2.2 Custom 3D augmentation with randAugment policy
8. Results
9. TMD classification is already a subjective thing. More annotation mean more input from the labeler which introduce more uncertainty.
